If you want to turn this setting off  this is what you need to do- Open Zoom in your browser. Go to Settings > Recordings > scroll down a little bit and you’ll see 'Require password to access shared cloud recordings.' If you turn this off then you won’t have to provide an access password to access your recording links.

If a course has an SISid then it is a controlled course and the term must match what the SISid has in it; we can not be changing to a different term or making it just 'default' term.  This is causing a problem with courses showing up on students’ dashboards when it should not.  If there is a need to extend access to a student then an 'extended incomplete section' needs to be created to extend that access.  Or the course dates (both begin and end) need to be set for special classes like an internship that goes longer that the semester. (Level 3 ticket)"],
            "Should we change the subaccount of past courses?": ["Also we should not be using the Non-academic subaccount or any other subaccount as a way to get around the fact that permissions are restricted in the subaccounts where teaching courses should reside.
